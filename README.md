# logistics-management-information-system
  This is developed based on the SSH framework for learning about logistics management systems and has implemented basic functions.
  Due to the upload limit, I had to split bos-web into two parts and lost some Maven configuration files, which could not be imported directly, But the code is all uploaded.For the first time, please excuse any mistakes there may be.
